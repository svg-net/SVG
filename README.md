# SVG.NET

Public fork of the C# SVG rendering library on codeplex: https://svg.codeplex.com/

This started out as a minor modification to enable the writing of proper SVG strings. But now after almost two years we have so many fixes and improvements that we decided to share our current codebase to the public in order to improve it even further.

So please feel free to fork it and open pull requests for any fix, improvement or feature you add.

It is also available via Nuget:

```
PM> Install-Package Svg
```

Release notes for the latest versions can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/vvvv/SVG/wiki/Release-Notes).

## Projects using the library

* [vvvv](http://vvvv.org) a hybrid visual/textual live-programming environment for easy prototyping and development.
* [Posh](https://github.com/vvvv/Posh) a windowing/interaction/drawing layer for C#/.NET desktop applications with their GUI in a browser. 
* [Timeliner](https://github.com/vvvv/Timeliner) a Posh based timeline that can be controlled by and sends out its values via OSC.
