# SVG.NET [![NuGet version](https://badge.fury.io/nu/svg.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/nu/svg)

Public fork of the C# SVG rendering library on codeplex: https://svg.codeplex.com/

This started out as a minor modification to enable the writing of proper SVG strings. But now after almost two years we have so many fixes and improvements that we decided to share our current codebase to the public in order to improve it even further.

So please feel free to fork it and open pull requests for any fix, improvement or feature you add. 
You may check the [contributing guide](https://github.com/vvvv/SVG/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to do this. 

For instructions on how to install and use the library, please check the [Getting Started](https://github.com/vvvv/SVG/wiki/Getting-started) guide.

Changes in the latest released versions and in master you can find in the 
[Release notes](https://github.com/vvvv/SVG/wiki/Release-Notes).

## Projects using the library

* [vvvv](http://vvvv.org) a hybrid visual/textual live-programming environment for easy prototyping and development.
* [Posh](https://github.com/vvvv/Posh) a windowing/interaction/drawing layer for C#/.NET desktop applications with their GUI in a browser.
