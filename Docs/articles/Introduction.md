# SVG.NET

Public fork of the C# SVG rendering library on CodePlex (now out of service). 

This started out as a private fork by [vvvv](https://vvvv.org) with some minor modification to enable the writing of proper SVG strings.
After almost two years of fixes and improvements the company decided to share the codebase with the public in order to improve it even further.
In 2021, the repository has been transferred from the company organization `vvvv` to the new organization `svg-net` (e.g. SVG.NET). 

Please feel free to fork it and open pull requests for any fix, improvement or feature you want to add.
You may check the [contributing guide](https://github.com/svg-net/SVG/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to do this.
